        <h2>What is Lumens?</h2>
        <p>
          Lumens is a lightweight JavaScript class for creating Slideshows in
          your webpage. The main focus points of Lumens are speed, compatibility
          and configuratibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is completely written in TypeScript and commented thorouhly so if
          you want to change the behaviour even further than all the options
          already allow, you'll be there in no time.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using other Slideshow classes, I often ran into problems with the
          given styling and having to overwrite the CSS that was bundled with
          the slider. Because of this, I made sure that Lumens only uses the
          bare minimum of inline styles and does affect the dom as little as
          possible. An additional CSS-File is NOT required. Just import the
          JavaScript file and you're golden.
        </p>

        <h2>Who should use Lumens</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of telling you that this is the best thing since sliced bread,
          I'm gonna be frank with you and tell you who Lumens is for and who
          probably should better look for an alternative.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a developer or just have a basic understanding of
          JavaScript and Webdevelopment and want to be able to integrate the
          slideshow as borderless as possible into your webapp Lumens might be
          just the thing for you. Just remember to consider the following few
          points:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Lumens ships with NO styling, so all the (S)CSS has to be written by
            you
          </li>
          <li>
            Lumens does NOT provide you with fancy functions like pagination,
            thumbnails or amazing animations but delivers the functions to build
            them your own
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who should NOT use Lumens</h2>
        <p>
          If the following sentence sounds something like you, you might want to
          look for an more automated alternative:

          "I have no knowledge in programming or webdevelopment, my nephew made
          my webpage with Wordpress and I only know how to change the text in
          there once in a while"
